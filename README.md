# Confluence By Merlin

A mobile application where Hackathon teams can look for teammates where other hackers are recommended based on their teams specific needs. The app runs on machine learning algorithms which helps your team to connect to the most compatible teammate you are looking for. The recommendations come with a touch of tinder based UI where you can swipe right to message the hacker to join your team and left to move to the next recommendation.

## Motivation

In this fast pacing world where computer science is a very competitive field winning hackathons gives you edge over most of the other applicants. So it is better you step up and get your game right. We understand that you might be a group of two friends looking to grow connections and to find your dream team like us, and now we want to make the process easier.
